  egy_1_desc:0 "Our victory over the Mongols is far in the past, when we were the foremost military power in the world. Times have changed and our armies are no longer what they were. It is time to improve the training of our troops to ensure we do not fall behind."
  egy_2_desc:0 "Since time immemorial the basis of Egypt's economy has been the Fellah farmer who farms his land as no more than a slave. It is time to reform this system to ensure that our farmers have a good incentive to grow more."

  GZM_legacy_of_zimbabwe_desc:0 "With the fall of Great Zimbabwe many traditions and customs have been lost. The Mutapa has built a new kind of state, independent of the age old legacy of these lands. Our people on the other hand have chosen to cling to old traditions, we still construct stone buildings that leave outsiders in awe and we still cherish that which once was."
  GZM_empowering_the_rozwi_desc:0 "A powerful faction has begun to grow in our lands, showing a strong loyalty to their leader and dissatisfaction with their lot in life in the Zimbabwe plateau. The Rozwi, or 'destroyers', are disciplined fighters ready to unify the Shona peoples and create a new type of state. If we do not embrace them we may well find ourselves overrun against our will."
  GZM_4_desc:0 "Discipline, preparation and training are what win battles. With this in mind our commanders have successfully begun to pioneer elaborate new tactics and a new army organization. Let us make good use of these innovations by dividing our warriors into regiments and then let them train regularly with their bows, assegais, daggers and axes. Practice will also allow them to fight in formation without fear, defeating much more numerous enemies."
  GZM_5_desc:0 "By Introducing a new System of Conscription we will ensure that we will have enough men to fill our ranks."
  GZM_6_desc:0 "The People of Great Zimbabwe are home to hostile terrain. Their knowledge of their home region will prove benefitial."
  GZM_vashambadzi_desc:0 "The growing intracontinental trade, with goods flowing back and forth from the central parts of the Kongo river basin to the trade cities of Eastern Africa, the Great Lakes and the Zimbabwe highlands has greatly enriched the Vashambadzi, our native merchant community. Let us support this group over all others by baring Swahili traders as well as European fortune seekers from trading within our borders."
