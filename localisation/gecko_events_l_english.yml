 flavor_buk.1.t:0 "Bukharan Wool"
 flavor_buk.1.d:0 "The Nomads, so long a threat to our nation's stability, are finding the incentives of sedentary life more and more attractive; however they struggle to find a place in this modern economy and languish in a form of destitute poverty, leading to unrest and banditry. By relocating them and their flocks and forcing them into treasury supported enterprises we can improve their production yield, support them economically, and make hefty profits through the taxes in the regions."
 flavor_buk.1.a:0 "Excellent."
 flavor_buk.2.t:0 "A Failed Investment?"
 flavor_buk.2.d:0 "To make matters worse, the market for wool has been shocked by recent good yields in Europe. Our biggest market is now buying cheaper and cheaper. The investment clearly hasn't panned out. The price of cloth is on the rise though, we could import Artisans into these provinces instead of a standard slave, possibly converting the province from basic wool production to cloth produce using their refined skills from the Indian subcontinent."
